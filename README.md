# Phase-1-Week-1-Toy-Problems

In this project I am working on 3 different coding challenges.
The repository has 3 different files each containing an implementation of 3 different functionalities as outlined below.

Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator(gradeGenerator.js).

This file contains a function that prompts the user to input student marks and assigns the corresponding grade. The grades are as follows: A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C - 59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less than 40.

Challenge 2: Speed Detector(speedDetector.js).

This file contains a program that takes the speed of a car as input and determines if the driver should receive any demerit points. If the speed is less than 70, the program prints "Ok". Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), the driver receives one demerit point and the total number of demerit points is printed. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the program prints "License suspended".

Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator.

This file contains a program that calculates an individual's net salary based on their basic salary and benefits. The program calculates the payee (tax), NHIF and NSSF deductions, gross salary, and net salary.
